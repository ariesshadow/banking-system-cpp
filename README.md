💰 Simple Banking System (C++)
A console-based banking system written in C++ that allows users to manage a virtual bank account. The program supports viewing balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and safe input handling.
This project demonstrates basic C++ concepts, input validation, and modular programming using functions.

➕ Deposit money with validation
➖ Withdraw money with balance checks
🛑 Prevents invalid input (non-numeric, negative values, overdraft)
🔁 Menu-driven interface using loops and switch-case
💵 Balance displayed with 2 decimal precision

🛠️ Concepts Used
Functions & modular design
switch statements
do-while loops
Input validation using cin.fail()
iomanip for formatted output
numeric_limits to clear input buffer

📋 Program Menu
1. Show Balance
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Exit

🧠 Input Validation Details
